## I am currently taking a Savvy Coders course to learn how to become a developer
---
### Some goals that I am hoping to achieve during this course:
- Learn Javascript
- Learn how develop a website
- Learn product planning skills
- Develop a functional site to hopefully continue to build upon after my time with Savvy
- Continue to develop new skills to progress my career
